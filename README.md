### Notes
1. All cars will race once every lane
    *FUTURE: Add option to race more than once on each lane*
1. Pack-level: Cars will race against random scouts, not by den/rank.  Each car races at least once on each lane.
1. District-level: Group ranks into separate races
1. Winners determined by lowest average time for all runs
1. Pack-level races will have four sets of races:
    1. Pack heats - all cub scouts race together
    1. Wildcard - 2nd place rank finishers play for one slot in the pack finals
    1. Open division heats - anyone/everyone competes, meager entry fee to cover trophy costs
        * Cars racing in the Pack heats are not eligible
    1. Pack finals - top finisher from each rank + the wild card
1. Also do practice runs, where we donâ€™t care which car runs where, but will want to see+keep the results.
1. Bring your smartphone/tablet/laptop to follow along!
