### Notes
1. All cars will race once every lane
    *FUTURE: Add option to race more than once on each lane*
1. Pack-level: Cars will race against random scouts, not by den/rank.  Each car races at least once on each lane.
1. District-level: Group ranks into separate races
1. Winners determined by lowest average time for all runs
1. Pack-level races will have four sets of races:
    1. Pack heats - all cub scouts race together
    1. Wildcard - 2nd place rank finishers play for one slot in the pack finals
    1. Open division heats - anyone/everyone competes, meager entry fee to cover trophy costs
        * Cars racing in the Pack heats are not eligible
    1. Pack finals - top finisher from each rank + the wild card
1. Also do practice runs, where we donâ€™t care which car runs where, but will want to see+keep the results.
1. Bring your smartphone/tablet/laptop to follow along!

### Registration notes
0. Registrars should bring a charged smartphone or tablet
0. Have them log in early and practice.  All they need to do is add Racers and sometimes Persons, where
they are not known in advance.
0. Have sharpies, maybe also stickers on-hand.  Registrars should label Racers with their ID number.  Numbering the cars makes them faster to find during the races.  Outside of that, this is only useful for the case where we have to fall back to manual procedures, or maybe if two cars look alike.
