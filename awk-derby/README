derby/awk-derby

Files in this directory are for a primitive, standalone awk-based derby
runner program.  It parses results received on a USB-serial connection
and displays the results on stdout.  This was run inside a maximized
terminal session with a font size set so the results from a single run
filled the screen.

These files are historical in nature, and are not a working part of
the python derby runner that followed it + hosts this github repo:
